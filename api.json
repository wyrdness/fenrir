      "full": "Fenrir (also called Fenrisúlfr) is a gigantic and monstrous wolf in Norse mythology, son of the trickster god Loki and the jötunn Angrboða. Brother to Jörmungandr (the World Serpent) and Hel (goddess of the underworld), Fenrir grew so large and dangerous that the gods decided he must be bound. After breaking two chains, Fenrir was finally restrained by Gleipnir, a magical ribbon made from impossible things. The binding cost the god Týr his right hand when Fenrir bit it off, realizing he'd been tricked. Prophecy states that at Ragnarök (the end of the world), Fenrir will break free, kill Odin the Allfather, and be slain in turn by Víðarr, Odin's son. Fenrir represents inevitable doom, the consequences of fear and broken trust, and chaos that cannot be permanently contained. His myth is central to the Norse understanding of fate, the limits of divine power, and the cyclical nature of destruction and renewal."
