      "full": "Fenrir (also called Fenrisúlfr) is a gigantic and monstrous wolf in Norse mythology, son of the trickster god Loki and the jötunn Angrboða. Brother to Jörmungandr (the World Serpent) and Hel (goddess of the underworld), Fenrir grew so large and dangerous that the gods decided he must be bound. After breaking two chains, Fenrir was finally restrained by **Gleipnir**, a magical ribbon made from impossible things. The binding cost the god Týr his right hand when Fenrir bit it off, realizing he'd been tricked. Prophecy states that at **Ragnarök** (the end of the world), Fenrir will break free, kill Odin the Allfather, and be slain in turn by Víðarr, Odin's son. Fenrir represents inevitable doom, the consequences of fear and broken trust, and chaos that cannot be permanently contained."
